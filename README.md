# CNTF - Load Test

## Purpose
This source code repository stores the configurations to load thousands of User Equipment devices (UEs) on the 5g core network. From loading the core with heavy traffic, this gives insights on how individual network functions are impacted.

## Deployment
Prerequisites:

* *Please ensure that you have configured the AWS CLI to authenticate to an AWS environment where you have adequate permissions to create an EKS cluster, security groups and IAM roles*: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html
* *Please ensure that the pipeline in the "CNTF-Main" repository has been successfully deployed, as this ensures that all necessary components are available to support the execution of scripts in this repository.*  


Steps:
1. Mirror this repository in Gitlab or connect this repository externally to Gitlab 
2. Authenticate Gitlab with AWS: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/cloud_deployment/
3. Perform these actions inside of the Gitlab repository:
    * On the left side of the screen click the drop-down arrow next to "Build" and select "Pipelines"
    * In the top right hand corner select "Run Pipeline"
    * In the drop-down under "Run for branch name or tag" select the appropriate branch name and click "Run Pipeline"
    * Once again, click the drop-down arrow next to "Build" and select "Pipelines", you should now see the pipeline being executed


## Coralogix Dashboards
